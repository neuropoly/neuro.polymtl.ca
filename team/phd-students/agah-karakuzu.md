## About

B.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering M.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering

I am currently a PhD student in Biomedical Engineering under the mentorship of Dr. Nikola Stikov.

My research is focused on developing a _reproducible quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging platform_ for neurocardiological experiments.

Besides being an open science enthusiast, I play an active role as a science communication contributor for ISMRM's MRPulse blog, MRM highlights and OHBM blog. I enjoy graphic designing, skiing and serving specialty coffee!
