Dr. Cohen-Adad completed his PhD in 2008 at the University of Montreal and pursued a 3-year postdoctoral fellowship at the MGH Martinos Center at Harvard University. He is now associate professor at [Polytechnique Montreal](https://www.polymtl.ca/en/), director of the Neuroimaging Research Laboratory at Polytechnique \(NeuroPoly\) and associate director of the [Neuroimaging Functional Unit](https://unf-montreal.ca/) at University of Montreal. Dr. Cohen-Adad has a background in MR physics and software development. His research focuses on the development of multi-parametric MRI techniques for quantifying microstructure in the brain and spinal cord. These developments include MRI coils, acquisition at ultra-high field \(7 Tesla\), quantitative techniques \(diffusion imaging, magnetization transfer, functional MRI\) and image processing software \(multimodal registration, segmentation, motion correction\). His lab has created and maintains multiple open-source software packages to process medical image data and control the MRI system remotely [more details here](https://github.com/sponsors/neuropoly). In collaboration with several international hospitals, he has been translating these advanced MRI techniques for studying patients with spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis. He has published over 145 articles \(see [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=6cAZ028AAAAJ&hl=en)\), edited [the first book on quantitative MRI of the spinal cord \(Elsevier\)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780123969736) and has organized several workshops at international conferences \(OHBM, ISMRM\).
