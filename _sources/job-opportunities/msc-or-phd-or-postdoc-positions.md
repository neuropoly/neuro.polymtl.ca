# MSc \| PhD \| PostDoc Positions

NeuroPoly Lab (Polytechnique, University of Montreal) is located in Montreal, best student-city in the world! \([https://www.topuniversities.com/city-rankings/2017](https://www.topuniversities.com/city-rankings/2017)\). We develop advanced MRI image analysis techniques using deep learning and distribute them as open-source software. In collaboration with neuroradiologists and world experts in deep learning (Mila), we apply these tools in patients with traumatic injury and neurodegenerative diseases (multiple sclerosis, ALS, etc.).

We are recruiting Master/PhD students and Postdoc fellows to work on various projects:

## Machine learning projects ⚙️

These projects are done in partnership with [Mila](https://mila.quebec/), with possible co-supervision from Mila profs.

### Generalization of deep learning models

![](../_media/project_geneneralization.png)

* **Description:** Most deep learning segmentation methods work for a specific data domain (eg: hospital, acquisition parameters, patient demographics). This strongly limits the dissemination of advanced solutions across various clinical and research centers. Some solutions, such as transfer learning, require the user to train a model, which is not realistic in a "real world" clinical scenario, where clinicians neither have the time nor the expertise to train models that work for their datasets. The goal of this project is to find solutions to make deep learning segmentation models work for a *large* variety of datasets. Few avenues include:
  * Incorporation of prior constraints from MRI physics during training;
  * Synthesizing images during data augmentation;
  * Careful selection of heterogeneous dataset;
* **Skills**: `deep learning` | `computer vision` | `python` | `git/GitHub`
* **Related projects**: [ivadomed](https://ivadomed.org)
* **Relevant publications**: [Lemay et al. MIDL 2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09582.pdf)
* **Contact**: [Julien Cohen-Adad](mailto:jcohen@polymtl.ca)


### Uncertainty estimation and applications

![](../_media/project_uncertainty.png)

* **Description:** A well-known bottleneck of deep learning segmentation methods is the high intra- and inter-rater variability, which limits the performance of supervised learning methods. The goal of this project is to incorporate uncertainty measures related to the inter-rater variability in the output predictions. Spin-off projects include:
  * Using uncertainty in active learning framework for histology and medical data segmentation;
  * Use [SoftSeg](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2021.102038) training framework to encode uncertainty.

### Lifelong learning of multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation

![](../.gitbook/assets/continual_learning_ms_segmentation.png)

* **Description**: The goal of this project is to implement a comprehensive and sustainable analysis framework for the segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in the brain and spinal cord. Deep learning models will be continuously updated with new data being prospectively acquired across several clinics in Canada. We will validate the clinical relevance of these models as a sensitive biomarker of disease severity and prognosis. The project focuses on three aims (the potential candidate student can pick the aim they are most interested in): 
  * Create a general model for brain and spinal cord MS lesion segmentation, robust to hospitals, MRI vendor and acquisition parameters; 
  * Implement a continuous learning framework and assess stability of model performance over time  using a retrospective database; 
  * Demonstrate the clinical relevance of automatic segmentation-based biomarkers.

### Analysis of MRI data from multiple sclerosis patients

![](../_media/project_ms_lesion_quantification.png)

* **Description**: Better understanding of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its diagnosis is key for the development of personalized therapy. MRI is an important diagnosis tool, but the use of advanced biomarkers is complex and requires further methodological development for it to be used by clinicians. The goal of this project is to develop and apply an pipeline for the analysis of MRI data from MS patients. The dataset consists of >1,000 patients coming from >12 international hospitals, with MS lesions labeled by neuroradiologists. Potential candidates can work on either of these sub-projects:
  * Set up an analysis pipeline to automatically process MRI scans, perform quality control of the analysed datasets (eg: identify failed automatic processes and find solutions);
  * Interpret the results with the help of neurologists, perform statistics to find best biomarkers from MRI data (eg: spinal cord cross-sectional area, MS lesion load).

### Realtime compensation of magnetic field variation in MRI (realtime shimming)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shimming-toolbox/doc-figures/master/overview/overview.gif)
 
* **Description**: To obtain a nice image inside the body, an MRI device assumes that the main magnetic field (B0) is homogeneous and stable over time. Unfortunately (or fortunately for the subject), subjects breathe while in the scanner. When subjects breathe, the B0 field varies in time and space. The NeuroPoly laboratory, in collaboration with Dr. Stockmann (Harvard/MIT), has developed hardware and software methods to compensate for these variations. The principle is based on the development of so-called "shim" coils, in which a direct current circulates, generating a magnetic field (Biot-Savart law) which compensates for the inhomogeneities of the B0 field. To orchestrate these complex experiments, the NeuroPoly laboratory has also developed free software: https://shimming-toolbox.org. We recruit Master/PhD/Postdoc students to work on real-time shimming projects. Examples of projects: implementation of optimization methods to find the right shim current combinations for each coil element (taking into account physical constraints, such as the maximum allowed current and dB/dt), experimentation with human subjects at 3T and 7T (taking measurements, image analysis), comparison and implementation of robust methods to map the B0 field, dynamic and real-time shimming of the spinal cord at 7T. The research will be conducted at the NeuroPoly laboratory (Polytechnique, Université de Montréal, www.neuro.polymtl.ca), at the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI, McGill University) and in collaboration with the Martinos Center (Harvard/MIT).

### Vendor-agnostic realtime shimming

* **Description**: In relation to the realtime shimming described above, it would be nice to be able to perform realtime shimming while using the internal gradient and shim coils from the MRI system itself. One difficulty is that a lot of code and access to the hardware on these proprietary systems are restricted. A solution would be to use an RTHawk system, which offers full modularity when driving the MRI system.
* **Skills**: Physics | Familiar with MRI | Computer programming | System integration | Experimentation | Image analysis
* **Related projects**: [Shimming Toolbox](https://shimming-toolbox.org/), [RTHawk environment](https://zenodo.org/record/3675442#.YakntPHMLkE)
* **Contact**: [Julien Cohen-Adad](mailto:jcohen@polymtl.ca)

### B0 Magnetic Field Mapping

* **Description**: We are recruiting MSc/PhD/postdoc to work on B0 magnetic field mapping at 3 T and 7 T. Many MRI techniques, such fMRI, DTI, and T2* mapping are highly sensitive to B0 inhomogeneities. B0-related artifacts can be minimized or eliminated if the B0 field distribution is known. Different approaches to measuring the B0 field have been proposed over the years. This project would aim to evaluate different B0 mapping techniques and propose B0 mapping procedures for 3 T and 7 T imaging. Research will be conducted at the NeuroPoly lab (Polytechnique, University of Montreal, [www.neuro.polymtl.ca](http://www.neuro.polymtl.ca/)\), and at the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI, McGill University).
