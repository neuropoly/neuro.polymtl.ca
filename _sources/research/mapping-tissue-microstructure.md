Realistic digital body tissue phantom for testing magnetic susceptiblity imaging techniques. The above images show simulated body tissue properties such as magnetic susceptiblity and relaxation. This digital phantom can be used to simulate data and test MR imaging techniques in different organs.

Realistic tissue model for simulating the q-space diffusion MR signal. The tissue model shown on the left was based on real histological data and represents five different fibre calibre distributions for five different regions of the human corpus callosum. Shown is a simulation for one region \(zoomed cube including fibres\). The simulation software enables us to choose a distribution of axon diameter, density, orientation and myelin thickness. Here we set realistic values from histology. The right panel shows a simulated MR signal given a set of q-space acquisition parameters, e.g., the diffusion time \(Δ\) and the maximum gradient strength \(Gmax\).

Above is an example of the application of biophysical models to characterizing white microstructure: the first mapping of axon diameter distributions in the human spinal cord in vivo. The scanning was performed using the 300 mT/m Connectome gradient system

Adding a myelin metric to the above data, and assuming a white matter model, it is possible to generate images with information on a scale that is orders of magnitude smaller than the native MR resolution. We call the images above 'simulated electron micrographs'.

## In Vivo Measurement of Myelin G-Ratio

![](../.gitbook/assets/g_ratio_framework.png)

The myelin g-ratio \(defined as the ratio of the inner to the outer diameter of the myelin sheath\) is a fundamental microstructural property of white matter that enables fast conduction of information. Variations in the g-ratio have been reported in histological studies of brain development and disease, but measuring it non-invasively in a living human being is a major challenge. Above is a white matter model that helps us define and compute the myelin g-ratio. This model allows us to extract microstructural information on a scale much smaller than the native MRI resolution. It assumes uniformity across the voxel of interest \(much like the rest of quantitative MRI\), and defines aggregate measures of the axon volume fraction, myelin volume fraction, fiber volume fraction, and the g-ratio.

![](../.gitbook/assets/whole_brain_g_ratio.png)

Using quantitative magnetization transfer (qMT) as a biomarker for MVF, and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) as a biomarker for AVF, we can compute whole-brain maps of the AVF, MVF and the myelin g-ratio.

## White Matter Microstructure in Multiple Sclerosis

![](../.gitbook/assets/dti_bpf_top_fibers_left.png)

By combining myelin and diffusion imaging, we can perform magnetic resonance tractometry and detect the level of myelination along white matter fibers. Above is an illustration of the fibers with the highest bound pool fraction \(myelin surrogate\) in five healthy volunteers.

![](../.gitbook/assets/ms_tractometry.png)

Above is a tractometry analysis in a cohort of MS patients, compared against healthy controls. On average, MS patients have lower magnetization transfer ratio \(myelin surrogate\) along tracts, which is consistent with lower myelin content in normal appearing white matter. However, the high MTR fibers \(90th percentile and above\) seem to be comparable in MS patients and in controls, suggesting that some normal appearing white matter may, in fact, be healthy.

In addition to tractometry analysis, combining diffusion and myelin imaging allows a voxelwise computation of the aggregate g-ratio, a measure of the relative myelin thickness. Above is an image showing lower fiber and myelin content in MS lesions \(arrows\), but the g-ratio is elevated only in the most recent lesion.

## Ex Vivo Imaging of Spinal Cord Injury

### Validation Using Histology

Model of spinal cord injury. The left panel shows the MRI performed in vivo after the injury. The middle and right panel respectively show the injury during dissection and after histology. The top histology slice shows that the injury spans the dorsal left segment, affecting both the dorsal column \(sensory\) and the corticospinal tract \(ascending\). The bottom histology slice shows uninjured tissue. V=Ventral, D=Dorsal, L=Left, R=Right

## Histological Validation of Quantitative MRI

![](../.gitbook/assets/histology_table.png)

The table above shows mean values \(± standard deviation\) of the axon volume fraction \(AVF\), myelin volume fraction \(MVF\), and g-ratio in a mid-sagittal slice of the corpus callosum \(CC\) of a cynomolgus macaque. The values in the top half of the table are obtained from MRI and the electron microscopy \(EM\) validation is on the bottom. In the middle of the table are segmented EM images \(myelin in red and axon in blue\) taken from each of the eight CC segments.

The biggest challenge for the experiment above was the small spatial coverage provided by the EM. To provide histological coverage that matches the scale of the MR images, we have recently imaged brain tissue using Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering \(CARS\). Image courtesy of Daniel Côté.
